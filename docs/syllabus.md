### Course Description
Computer vision allows machines to see and understand their environment. This course will equip students with the practical skills and critical theory needed to both employ and critically engage these techniques. Real-time body tracking, facial recognition and gesture analysis using RGB+D. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will be emphasized. Students will explore and critique contemporary applications ranging from automated mass surveillance to interactive installations. A final project will build on in- class workshops, technical exercises, critical readings and discussions.

### Course Goals
* Working and applied knowledge of creative coding practices
* Working and applied knowledge of “classical” computer vision techniques.
* Working and applied knowledge of "modern" computer vision techniques that leverage machine learning.

### Course Values
* Sharing / Open
    * Documentation

### Methodology

Students will engage in individual in-lab and home assignments, class presentations, lectures, discussions, assigned readings, group and individual projects and desk critiques. Visiting artists / faculty may enhance the experience and offer additional perspectives.

### Class Structure (Typical)
9:00 - 9:30 : Look at new artists, catch up on the week’s CV/ML headlines.<br>
9:30 - 10:15 : Lecture Part 1.<br>
10:15 - 10:30 : Break<br>
10:30 - 12:00 : Lecture Part 2.<br>
12:00 - 01:00 : Lunch<br>
01:00 - 02:30 : Hands-on Workshop.<br>
02:30 - 02:45 : Break<br>
02:45 - 04:00 : Open Studio (Homework, Projects, Discussion, etc).<br>


### Assignments
The first 10 weeks of the course will be built on well-constrained code-based assignments. These assignments have clear goals and are intended to build confidence and code competency. The last 5 weeks of the course are focused on integrating these techniques, technologies and critical discussions with your existing creative / research practice. 


### Creative Coding Tools
We will be doing most of our work with __P5.js__ on the web, with potential for some Processing and C++/openFrameworks. While many modern computer vision and machine learning tools are built with C++ at their core, many powerful creative tools have become available that allow web-based applications to utilize computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Open source tools available online use a variety of coding languages and frameworks. Students are encouraged to find tools outside of what is introduced in class when composing final projects.


### Class Text(s)
There is no single class text, though there are several online books (and available for purchase) that we’ll reference on occasion.
openFrameworks
ofBook

### End of semester exhibition (tentative)
Depending on availability, final projects will be included in an exhibition at the end of the semester.
                      
 Materials
Provided by the student as needed.
Attendance
1. Students are best served by attending all classes.
2. Missing three classes will result in a class failure. This is strictly enforced.
3. Six or more unexcused late arrivals or early departures will result in class failure.
Tip: If you are going to be absent, late to class, or need to depart early, please contact me BEFORE class starts. This is so I can make sure you have what you need to succeed!
Wait Lists
Students wait-listed for classes will be admitted on a space available basis determined by instructors’ discretion (in consultation with the department chair).
Grading Procedure/Criteria
Grades are credit / no-credit for this course. Credit is based on several factors: 30% participation (discussions, critiques, etc), 70% projects / assignments.
Incomplete grades will not be offered.

Disability and Learning Resource Center
Study Sessions
Students are encouraged to form a study group to meet and work on the homework. The TA will be available during TA office hours (TBA).
