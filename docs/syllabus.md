## Course Description
Computer vision allows machines to see and understand their environment. This course will equip students with the practical skills and critical theory needed to both employ and critically engage these techniques. Real-time body tracking, object and facial recognition, and gesture analysis. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning will be emphasized. Machine learning applications related to text and sound and reinforcement learning will also be discussed, although in-class exercises will not focus on them.<br>

Students will explore and critique contemporary applications ranging from automated mass surveillance to interactive installations. A final project will build on in-class workshops, technical exercises, critical readings and discussions.

## Course Goals
* Working and applied knowledge of creative coding practices
* Working and applied knowledge of “classical” computer vision techniques.
* Working and applied knowledge of "modern" computer vision techniques that leverage machine learning.

### Course Values
* Sharing / Open
    * Documentation
    * <a href="http://archive.furtherfield.org/projects/diwo-do-it-others-resourceDIWO" target="blank">DIWO (Do It With Others)</a>
    * Publish

## Methodology

Students will engage in individual in-lab and home assignments, class presentations, lectures, discussions, assigned readings, group and individual projects and desk critiques. Visiting artists / faculty may enhance the experience and offer additional perspectives.

## Class Structure (Typical)
9:00 - 9:30 : Look at new artists, catch up on the week’s CV/ML headlines.<br>
9:30 - 10:15 : Lecture Part 1.<br>
10:15 - 10:30 : Break<br>
10:30 - 12:00 : Lecture Part 2.<br>
12:00 - 01:00 : Lunch<br>
01:00 - 02:30 : Hands-on Workshop.<br>
02:30 - 02:45 : Break<br>
02:45 - 04:00 : Open Studio (Homework, Projects, Discussion, etc).<br>


## Assignments
The first 10 weeks of the course will be built on well-constrained code-based assignments. These assignments have clear goals and are intended to build confidence and code competency:
* Weeks 1-4 weeks emphasize code and "classic" computer vision techniques.
* Weeks 5-10 emphasize machine learning approaches and data acquisition/curation.
* Weeks 11-15 week of the course are focused on integrating these techniques, technologies and critical discussions with your existing creative / research practice. 


## Creative Coding Tools
We will be doing most of our work with __P5.js__ on the web, with potential for some Processing and C++/openFrameworks. While many modern computer vision and machine learning tools are built with C++ at their core, many powerful creative tools have become available that allow web-based applications to utilize computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Open source tools available online use a variety of coding languages and frameworks. Students are encouraged to find tools outside of what is introduced in class when composing final projects.


## Class Text(s)
There is no single class text, though there are online books, guides and articles we'll reference throughout the semester.

## End of semester exhibition (tentative)
Depending on availability, final projects will be included in an exhibition at the end of the semester.
                      
## Materials
Some machines are available in the classroom for deep learning projects, but students should bring their personal devices to complete their assignments. Peripheral devices (webcams, Kinects, etc.) are available to check out from the ATS tech room.

## Attendance
* Students are best served by attending all classes.
* Missing three classes will result in a class failure. This is strictly enforced.
* Six or more unexcused late arrivals or early departures will result in class failure. Class will begin promptly at 9am.
Tip: If you are going to be absent, late to class, or need to depart early, please contact me BEFORE class starts.

## Wait Lists
Students wait-listed for classes will be admitted on a space available basis determined by instructors’ discretion (in consultation with the department chair).

## Grading Procedure/Criteria
Grades are credit / no-credit for this course. Credit is based on several factors:
* 30% participation (discussions, critiques, etc)
* 70% projects / assignments. All assignments must be completed in order to receive credit for this class<br>
* Incomplete grades will not be offered.

## Study Sessions/Tutor hours

Based on class availability, I plan to be available once a week for a couple hours to help reinforce in-class concepts. I will not be providing homework answers in these sessions. Please attempt the homework before attending these sessions. Students are encouraged to work together on homework assignments.
