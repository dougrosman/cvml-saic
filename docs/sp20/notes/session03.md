1. Simple code; complex installations (imagine using simple brightness averaging to trigger an effect. although at that point you could just use a photocell)
1. It's all just numbers. If you can calculate a brightest point, you can make stuff follow it.


## Code

1. Quick HTML/CSS gallery setup.
1. Images Particle Systems
1. Brightest point
1. Drawing with brightestpoint + createGraphics
1. Making things follow brightest point with ATAN2+lerp
1. Following particle system

1. Perlin noise
1. Mapping
1. Background subtraction
1. Frame differencing
1. Optical Flow
1. Point Tracking


1. In-class assignment: build up a brightest-point drawing program
1. In-class assignment: build up a brightest-point follow program
